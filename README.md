# GUI-Calendar
A GUI calendar application written in Java using MVC (Model/View/Controller) architecture.
Initial screen displays the current month view of the calendar and highlights the current day.
Functionalities include being able to create, import, and export events onto the calendar.


Next Steps:
  - Change 24-hour clock format to 12-hour
  - Create back/forth buttons for months
  - Use serialization for events
  - Align days of week more properly
  - Display events in a more elegant manner
  - Highlight the days with events (maybe?)
  - Create an "Options" menu
